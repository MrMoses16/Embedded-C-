For my Embedded Systems class at UCF, I used the TI LaunchPad featuring the MSP430FR6989 
microcontroller along with the TI BoosterPack to complete the following lab assignments. 
Before running the following code files, you may need to import the following files: 
#include <msp430fr6989.h> #include "intrinsics.h" #include <msp430.h> . 
Furthermore, labs 1-6 only use the LaunchPad while the 7-9 use both the LaunchPad and 
BoosterPack. At the top of every code file is a YouTube link given by my TA's to demonstrate 
the final outcome of the lab assignment. My goal for each lab was to learn how to implement 
the topic at hand and reverse engineer the code used in the YouTube video onto my 
LaunchPad/BoosterPack.
